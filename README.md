### Message:
<b>First and foremost this project is dedicated to the players, modders, developers, and anyone else that makes Project Zomboid what it is - the ultimate zombie survival RPG.</b>

####
### This community project is a team effort to centralize quality of life changes or fixes, utility functions, and making the available Lua files easier to work with in respect to both compatibility and modability.

###
## Workflow
#### Everything will be developed alongside the most recent version of PZ (including any IWBUMS/open beta branches).

- Create/Publish your own branch/fork.  
- Do your work on that branch/fork.
- Create a Pull Request and select reviewers.  
- After quality control the merge will be completed.  
- The branch will be deleted.  
- Repeat the same process.  
  
### Update Policy:
- Workshop update weekly or daily if hotfix are required.
- Readme can be updated without creating new branches.
